Build a complete frontend for a website called CollabNexus using:

React

Vite

Tailwind CSS

Firebase Auth + Firebase Firestore (web SDK)

Interactive + slightly animated UI (smooth transitions, hover effects, card animations)

The frontend must connect to an existing backend already built with Flask + Firebase Admin + Firestore with routes:

/signup

/login

/projects

/projects/<project_id>/tasks

/projects/<project_id>/progress

Real-time features should use Firestore onSnapshot().

(1) Skill Matchmaking

Upload user skills

Button: Find Teammates

Show recommended collaborators using the user’s skills

(2) Project Hub

Create projects

Assign tasks to team members

Kanban-style task board:
